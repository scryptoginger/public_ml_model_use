# Safe Model Usage: Securely Use, Scan, and Package Public ML Models

This project is a **hands-on tool & educational reference** to demonstrate how to do the following, securely: 
- Download a public machine learning model without exposing oneself (ex: from Hugging Face)
- Scan the model for vulnerabilities using `modelscan`
- Use the model safely for inference
- Re-scan the model post-usage
- Package and distribute the model and its artifacts with `kitops`

> This project is intended for internal teams working within the VA MAP infrastructure and MLOps security best practices.
